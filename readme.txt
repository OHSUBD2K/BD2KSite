Thank you for your interest in the BD2K Open Educational Resourses.

*** File Formats ***

There are two types of Learning Management System (LMS) compatible files available for integration into various LMS structures. One package is a SCORM 1.2 compliant and the other is TIN CAN API compliment. Both of these packages are given in a .zip format, as that is the most common form of implementation. The tracking in each of these packages is based on completion of the presentation. Please, consult with your LMS support staff about which type of package you need.

The slides are in the pptx format.

The audio is a mp3.

The resource list is a pdf.

Exercises are presented in a .zip format. 

*** Labeling ***

For each module, the content is broken into smaller sections, generally from 3 to 7 depending on the module.

For example, the first course is labeled BDK01. Each of the smaller sections for the BDK01 module are indicated with a dash and a number (BDK01-1, BDK01-2,...).
